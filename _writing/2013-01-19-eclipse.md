The dark umbra of your absence fell heavy  
onto the place where you once left your mark  
but your shadow walked alongside with me  
trodding repeatedly over that piece of barren land we call heart  

since then I have left the door of my life ajar  
in case halfway you decide to turn back  
change your mind and change your path  
you’ll see nothing but scattered dreams, hopes and scars  
but for you I am willing to start all over  
to go back to the times we hummed the tunes of the same music track  
the same panic attack, that same careless laugh  

It only takes a movie, a scene, a word  
to remember everything we did together  
falling back in love ain’t very far, my darling  
for we were born in the eclipse of the very same star.
