we finally settle in the reaction mixture  
at a point where the colours stop swirling  
in a world where they cannot see  
there is just enough of you to keep me going  

tunnel lights gradually fade to make way for golden memories  
once upon a time when you and I talked for hours without pausing for breath in between  
my voice falls soft as you gently catch them  
with awkward laughs and lame returns that trap me  
if it makes you uncomfortable, I wonâ€™t even breathe  
for the time I spent with you will precipitate as light blue crystals  
dazzling in their pure fragility  

how do I tell myself not to be greedy  
that this is the best we can be  
anymore of anything would just leave us sizzling with heat  
keep the monster at bay  
let us just stay this way  

we finally settle in the reaction mixture  
you unknowingly add a little warmth with your smile  
and the equilibrium is upset again
