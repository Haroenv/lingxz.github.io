there's always this saying that love completes  
a person, like a jigsaw piece meeting its neighbour  
loneliness is a terrible thing, I admit  
no matter how you fill them there are always spaces  
and no matter who you talk to there are always more words  

but when no one could understand my jagged edges  
I never needed anyone to make me whole  
not like petals to a flower, or sodium to chlorine  
I'm glad I met you when I'm mature enough to understand  
that I'm not afraid of being alone  
you don't complete me  
because we are already individually complete  
each a full puzzle replete with its many secrets  
each a noble gas  

you don't complete me  
you are not my sun--we are two colliding stars  
found each other after years of trekking through the coldness of the universe  
the way the chaotic mathematical space of probability says "surprise!"  

not in the way a jigsaw puzzle piece desperately needs its neighbour  
to fill its gaps of emptiness  
no I don't need you to complete me, I never did  
you are  
a wonderful wonderful gift  
from a mathematical conspiracy of the universe  
(just get in the box >D)
