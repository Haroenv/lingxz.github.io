**What you can find here:**

- [Blog posts]({{ '/posts/' | absolute_url }}), where it's mostly some ramblings about the interesting things I find on the Internet,
- [Writing pieces]({{ '/writing/' | absolute_url }}), including [poems]({{ '/poetry/' | absolute_url }}) and [essays]({{'/essays/' | absolute_url }}) where I think a bit more about life, 
- and other random lists that I've gathered over the years and are updated as and when, such as favourite quotes, books, movies, etc (WIP).
