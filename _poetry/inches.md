If, years later, you look back on our story  
the story that you so painstakingly wrote with me  
never ever let regret taint the pages, my darling  
we missed love by inches, it seems  
but in those frames you were smiling, and that’s all that matters.  
  
If, years later, you look back on our story  
don’t think of the story that could have been  
never let tears stain anything so pure, my darling  
we missed love by inches, it seems  
but you were laughing without a care in the world  
and that’s all that I’m going to remember.  
  
If by some chance you do look back on our story  
the story that was ours and ours only  
never worry about me, my dear  
we might have missed love by inches  
but in those days  
we laughed till we teared and hugged till we hurt  
it was almost as if we were lovers.
