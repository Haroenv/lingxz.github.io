This is the obligatory Hello World post :smile:

So, I decided to set up a Jekyll blog. 

Why? Mostly because Github's student developer pack includes a free .me domains from Namecheap, and I felt I had to do something with it to make it worthwhile. 

What better to do with it than to properly design and customize my personal corner of the internet?  

Then the next question is: dynamic or static?

A dynamic site seems excessive for what is essentially going to be static content, so static site it is. 

Everything else followed quite painlessly from there. Jekyll was the obvious choice--it has the largest community and is supported by Jekyll. 

And I could also learn some Ruby. 

It was a good learning process. I started out with the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) by Michael Rose, and while it presented quite a steep learning curve, I picked up some `sass` on the way too. 

Setting up the commenting system took a bit more hassle, since I didn't like how Disqus looks and the theme currently does not support Staticman v2 (though it supports a great many other things). But Michael Rose's [guide to setting up Staticman v2](https://mademistakes.com/articles/improving-jekyll-static-comments/) is comprehensive enough and now threaded comments are working perfectly. The only problem: I still haven't gotten email notifications to work yet. 

There are, of course, still many things to improve on. 

For one, I'm still figuring out what's the best way to have Chinese search on a static site. 

And eventually, I will probably MathJax or KaTeX support, so that if I wanted to write about physics, I could.
