<h1 id="hellothere">Hello there.</h1>

<p>This is the blog of <a href="http://theconfused.me">Lingyi</a>. </p>

<p>I like to read, write, take photos, and look at stars. This blog contains some of my short creative works (mostly in Chinese). I also write about tech and physics in my blog posts, and otherwise ramble about some of the interesting things I find on the Internet. </p>
