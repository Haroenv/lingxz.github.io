## Working with Squiffy
First thought: Such a cute name! I came across it only accidentally. It's yet another interactive fiction engine, only this time it's written completely in javascript. That's a relief. I struggled with `ink`'s syntax a fair bit. 

build overwrites the whole file, so I installed the command line tool.
